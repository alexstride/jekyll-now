title: Genetic Algorithms 1 - Getting Stuck In
---

Plan: 
1. Mission statement of this series of the blog (This is a series of articles to document my exploration of genetic algorithms, as I have some ideas for potential applications and want to see what they are capable of).

2. Documentation of resources followed so far + links. 

3. Links to the python library which I have written and brief gif of the genetic a basic phrase being evolved.
